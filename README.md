# JNAEngineVisualizer
This is a simple 3D software renderer I wrote a while ago. I repurposed it for use with JNA and the physics engine I am working on to visualize the world.

To use this, compile the latest version of 3D engine for 64 bit for release (make sure that the JNAInterfaceFunctions.h isn't disabled by _WIN64)
copy core.dll into the bin filder of this project and it should run fine.
